# synlang
A language for creating and running modular synthesizer patches

I don't like graphical synths like PD or Max or Reaktor, so I'm making this. At the moment, it's not functional.
You can see examples of what the language might look like in the `drafts` directory.

Synlang is going to be a language to describe and run a synth in real time. Interactivity is planned, and live patching is being thought about.
Support for plan9 is planned to be the default for the foreseeable future because who wants to use alsa or pulseaudio.
